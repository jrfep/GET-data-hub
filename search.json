Credit: Darren Robb / Getty Images\n\n\nEcosystem properties: These ecosystems are artificial wetlands with low horizontal and vertical heterogeneity fed by rain or irrigation water diverted from rivers. They are predominantly temporary wetlands, regularly filled and dried, although some are permanently inundated, functioning as simplified marshes. Allochthonous inputs come from water inflow but also include the introduction of aquatic crops such as rice, lotus or tarot, other production organisms (e.g. fish and crustaceans), and fertilisers that promote plant growth. Simplified trophic networks are sustained by seasonal, deterministic flooding and drying regimes and the agricultural management of harvest crops, weeds, and pests. Cultivated macrophytes dominate primary production, but other autotrophs contribute, including archaea, cyanobacteria, phytoplankton, and benthic or epiphytic algae. During flooded periods, microbial changes produce anoxic soil conditions and emissions by methanogenic archaea. Opportunistic colonists include consumers such as zooplankton, insects, fish, frogs, and waterbirds, as well as other aquatic plants. Often they come from nearby natural wetlands or rivers and may breed within these croplands. During dry phases, obligate aquatic organisms are confined to wet refugia beyond the croplands. These species possess traits that promote tolerance to low water quality and predator avoidance. Others organisms, including many invertebrates and plants, have rapid life cycles and dormancy traits allowing persistence as eggs or seeds during dry phases.\n\n\n\nDiagram Description automatically generated\n\n\nEcological drivers: Engineering of levees and channels enables the retention of standing water a few centimetres above the soil surface and rapid drying at harvest time. This requires reliable water supply either through summer rains in the seasonal tropics or irrigation in warm-temperate or semi-arid climates. The water has high oxygen content and usually warm temperatures. Deterministic water regimes and shallow depths limit niche diversity and have major influences on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils, which contain high nutrient levels. Aquatic croplands are often established on former floodplains but may also be created on terraced hillsides. Other human interventions include cultivation and harvest, aquaculture, and the addition of fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides.\nDistribution: More than a million square kilometres, mostly in tropical and subtropical Southeast Asia, with small areas in Africa, Europe, South America, North America, Australia and Pacific.\n\n\nReferences:\nFernando CJH (1993) Rice field ecology and fish culture—an overview.

    "text": "T7.1 Short-rotation croplands\nEcosystem properties: High-productivity croplands are maintained by intensive anthropogenic supplementation of nutrients, water, and artificial disturbance regimes (e.g. annual cultivation), translocation (e.g. sowing), and harvesting of short-lived plants. These systems are typically dominated by one or few shallow-rooted, short-lived, typically non-woody plant species such as grains (mostly C3 grasses), vegetables, ‘flowers’, legumes, or fibre species harvested destructively or renewed on cycles of less than one to a few years by humans for commercial or subsistence production of food, materials, or ornamental displays. Disequilibrium community structure and composition is maintained by translocations and/or managed reproduction of target species and usually by periodic application of herbicides and pesticides and/or culling to exclude competitors, predators, herbivores, and/or pathogens. Thus, compared to antecedent ‘natural’ systems, croplands are structurally simple, have low functional, genetic, and taxonomic diversity and no local endemism. Subsistence croplands, including Swidden rotation systems, are typically more diverse than industrial croplands. Productivity is highly sensitive to variations in resource availability. Target biota are genetically manipulated by selective breeding or molecular engineering to promote rapid growth, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, insect predators, and diseases. Typically, at least 40% of net primary productivity is appropriated by humans. Croplands may be rotated inter-annually with livestock pastures or fallow fields (T7.2) or may be integrated into mixed cropping-livestock systems. Target biota coexists with a cosmopolitan ruderal biota (e.g. weedy plants, mice, and starlings) that exploits production landscapes opportunistically through efficient dispersal, itinerant foraging, rapid establishment, high fecundity, and rapid population turnover. Native biota from adjoining non-anthropogenic systems may also interact with croplands. When actively managed systems are abandoned or managed less intensively, these non-target biota, especially non-woody plants, become dominant and may form a steady, self-maintaining state or a transitional phase to novel ecosystems.\n\n\n\nDiagram Description automatically generated\n\n\n\n\n\nWheat crop post-harvest, Crookston, Minnesota, USA. Credit: Andy Sacks / Getty Images\n\n\nEcological drivers: The high to moderate natural availability of water (from at least seasonally high rainfall) and nutrients (from fertile soils) is often supplemented by human inputs via irrigation, landscape drainage modifications (e.g. surface earthworks), and/or fertiliser application by humans. Intermittent flooding may occur where croplands replace palustrine wetlands. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. These systems are typically associated with flat to moderate terrain accessible by machinery. Artificial disturbance regimes (e.g. annual ploughing) maintain soil turnover, aeration, nutrient release, and relatively low soil organic carbon content.\nDistribution: Tropical to temperate humid climatic zones or river flats in dry climates across south sub-Saharan and North Africa, Europe, Asia, southern Australia, Oceania, and the Americas.\n\n\nReferences\nLeff B, Ramankutty N, Foley JA (2004) Geographic distribution of major crops across the world.

    "text": "T7.3 Plantations and woody croplands\nEcosystem properties: These moderate to high productivity autotrophic systems are established by the translocation (i.e. planting or seeding) of woody perennial plants, or very rarely non-woody (e.g. bananas). Target biota may be genetically manipulated by selective breeding or molecular engineering to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance of harsh environmental conditions, insect predators, and diseases. The diversity, structure, composition, function, and successional trajectory of the ecosystem depends on the identity, developmental stage, density, and traits (e.g. phenology, physiognomy, and growth rates) of planted species, as well as the subsequent management of plantation development. Most plantations comprise at least two vertical strata (the managed woody species and a ruderal ground layer). Mixed forest plantings may be more complex and host a relatively diverse flora and fauna if managed to promote habitat features. Cyclical harvest may render the habitat periodically unsuitable for some biota. Mixed cropping systems may comprise two vertical strata of woody crops or a woody and herbaceous layer. Secondary successional processes involve colonisation and regeneration, initially of opportunistic biota. Successional feedbacks occur as structural complexity increases, promoting visits or colonisation by vertebrates and the associated dispersal of plants and other organisms. Crop replacement (which may occur on multi-annual or decadal cycles), the intensive management of plantation structure, or the control of non-target species may reset, arrest, or redirect successional processes. Examples with increasing management intervention include: environmental plantations established for wildlife or ecosystem services; agroforestry plantings for subsistence products or livestock benefits; forestry plantations for timber, pulp, fibre, bio-energy, rubber, or oils; and vineyards, orchards, and other perennial food crops (e.g. cassava, coffee, tea, palm oil, and nuts). Secondary (regrowth) forests and shrublands are not included as plantations even where management includes supplementary translocations.\n\n\n\nHarvesting in tea plantations, Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka.

Rainfall is at least seasonally high. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. Artificial disturbance regimes involving the complete or partial removal of biomass and soil turnover are implemented at sub-decadal to multi-decadal frequencies.\n\nDistribution: Tropical to cool temperate humid climatic zones or river flats in dry climates across south sub-Saharan and Mediterranean Africa, Europe, Asia, southern Australia, Oceania, and the Americas.\n\nReferences\nKanninen M (2010) Plantation forests: global perspectives.

Credit: R A Kearton /Getty Images\n\n\nEcosystem properties: Structurally simple, high-productivity pastures are maintained by the intensive anthropogenic supplementation of nutrients (more rarely water) and artificial disturbance regimes (e.g. periodic ploughing), translocation (e.g. livestock movement and sowing), and harvesting of animals or plants. The magnitude of these inputs distinguish these systems from semi-natural pastures and rangelands in biomes T4 and T5 used for less intense livestock production. They are dominated by one or few selected plant species (C3 and C4 perennial pasture grasses and/or herbaceous legumes) and animal species (usually large mammalian herbivores) for commercial production of food or materials, ornamental displays, or sometimes subsistence. Their composition and structure is maintained by the translocation and/or managed reproduction of target species and the periodic application of herbicides and pesticides and/or culling to exclude competitors, predators, herbivores, or pathogens. Consequently, compared to ‘natural’ rangeland systems and semi-natural pastures, these systems have low functional and taxonomic diversity and little or no local endemism. Target biota are genetically manipulated to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, diseases, and predators, . They are harvested by humans continuously or periodically for consumption or maintenance. Typically, at least 40% of net primary productivity is appropriated by humans. Major examples include intensively managed production pastures for livestock or forage (e.g. hay). Livestock pastures may be rotated inter-annually with non-woody crops (T7.1), or they may be managed as mixed silvo-pastoral systems (T7.3). Target biota coexist with native and cosmopolitan ruderal biota that exploits production landscapes through efficient dispersal, rapid establishment, high fecundity, and rapid population turnover. When the ecosystem is abandoned or managed less intensively, non-target biota become dominant and may form a steady, self-maintaining state or a transitional phase to novel ecosystems.\n\n\n\nDiagrammatic Assembly Model\n\n\nEcological drivers: High to moderate natural availability of water and nutrients is typically supplemented by human inputs via water management, landscape drainage modifications (e.g. surface earthworks), and/or fertiliser application at varied rates. Intermittent flooding may occur where pastures replace palustrine wetlands. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. Typically associated with moderately fertile substrates and flat to undulating terrain accessible by machinery. Artificial disturbance regimes (e.g. ploughing for up to 5 years/decade) maintain soil turnover, aeration, and nutrient release.\n\n\n\nMap Description automatically generated\n\n\nDistribution: Mostly in tropical to temperate climatic zones and developed countries across Europe, east and south Asia, subtropical and temperate Africa, southern Australasia, north and central America, and temperate south America.\n\nReferences\nBernués A, Ruiz R, Olaizola A, Villalba D, Casasús I (2011) Sustainability of pasture-based livestock farming systems in the European Mediterranean context: Synergies and trade-offs.
