The name of this ecosystem functional group in version 2.1 of the Global Ecosystem Typology is *Sown pastures and fields*. However, fields occur in other ecosystem functional groups as well as this one (for example in T7.1). We thus note the potential alternative name Sown pastures, excluding specific mention of fields.

***Revision summary***: Rename *T7.2 Sown livestock pastures*

***Origin***: Agricultural ecosystems WG (Driver & Botts 2025)

***Justification***: 

***Current status***: Proposal considered by GET-SC on 8/9/2025 and approved for implementation.

***Ecosystem properties***: Structurally
simple, high-productivity pastures are maintained by the intensive
anthropogenic supplementation of nutrients (more rarely water) and
artificial disturbance regimes (e.g. periodic ploughing), translocation
(e.g. livestock movement and sowing), and harvesting of animals or
plants. The magnitude of these inputs distinguish these systems from
semi-natural pastures and rangelands in biomes T4 and T5 used for less
intense livestock production. They are dominated by one or few selected
plant species (C3 and C4 perennial pasture grasses and/or herbaceous
legumes) and animal species (usually large mammalian herbivores) for
commercial production of food or materials, ornamental displays, or
sometimes subsistence. Their composition and structure is maintained by
the translocation and/or managed reproduction of target species and the
periodic application of herbicides and pesticides and/or culling to
exclude competitors, predators, herbivores, or pathogens. Consequently,
compared to 'natural' rangeland systems and semi-natural pastures, these
systems have low functional and taxonomic diversity and little or no
local endemism. Target biota are genetically manipulated to promote
rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource
allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental
conditions, diseases, and predators, . They are harvested by humans
continuously or periodically for consumption or maintenance. Typically,
at least 40% of net primary productivity is appropriated by humans.
Major examples include intensively managed production pastures for
livestock or forage (e.g. hay). Livestock pastures may be rotated
inter-annually with non-woody crops
([T7.1](https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T7.1)), or they may
be managed as mixed silvo-pastoral systems (T7.3). Target biota coexist
with native and cosmopolitan ruderal biota that exploits production
landscapes through efficient dispersal, rapid establishment, high
fecundity, and rapid population turnover. When the ecosystem is
abandoned or managed less intensively, non-target biota become dominant
and may form a steady, self-maintaining state or a transitional phase to
novel ecosystems.

***Ecological drivers***: High to moderate
natural availability of water and nutrients is typically supplemented by
human inputs via water management, landscape drainage modifications
(e.g. surface earthworks), and/or fertiliser application at varied
rates. Intermittent flooding may occur where pastures replace palustrine
wetlands. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. Typically
associated with moderately fertile substrates and flat to undulating
terrain accessible by machinery. Artificial disturbance regimes (e.g.
ploughing for up to 5 years/decade) maintain soil turnover, aeration,
and nutrient release.

***Distribution***: Mostly in tropical to
temperate climatic zones and developed countries across Europe, east and
south Asia, subtropical and temperate Africa, southern Australasia,
north and central America, and temperate south America.
