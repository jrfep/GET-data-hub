The name of this ecosystem functional group in version 2.1 of the Global Ecosystem Typology is *Sown pastures and fields*. However, fields occur in other ecosystem functional groups as well as this one (for example in T7.1). We thus note the potential alternative name Sown pastures, excluding specific mention of fields.
