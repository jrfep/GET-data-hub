The name of this ecosystem functional group in version 2.1 of the Global Ecosystem Typology is Plantations. However, based on the description it is clearly intended to include woody croplands as well as plantations. We thus note the potential alternative name Plantations and woody croplands.

***Revision summary***: T7.3 Rename and resolve conflation between plantations and perennial crops

***Origin***: Review of agricultural and plantation forestry ecosystems in the GET, engaging the Agricultural ecosystems ad hoc working
group (Driver and Botts 2025).

***Justification***: Resolve confusion between plantations for wood and perennial food crops produced by woody plants. Need to define the ecological similarities, i.e. beyond use of of the product (wood, fibre, biofuel, food), may require associated ajustments to text

***Current status***: Proposal considered by GET-SC on 8 Sep 2025 and approved  for public consultation on draft update

## T7.3 Plantations [and woody croplands]{.mark}

***Ecosystem properties***: These moderate
to high productivity autotrophic systems are established by the
translocation (i.e. planting or seeding) of woody perennial plants[, or
very rarely non-woody (e.g. bananas)]{.mark}. Target biota may be
genetically manipulated by selective breeding or molecular engineering
to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced
resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance of harsh
environmental conditions, insect predators, and diseases. The diversity,
structure, composition, function, and successional trajectory of the
ecosystem depends on the identity, developmental stage, density, and
traits (e.g. phenology, physiognomy, and growth rates) of planted
species, as well as the subsequent management of plantation development.
Most plantations comprise at least two vertical strata (the managed
woody species and a ruderal ground layer). Mixed forest plantings may be
more complex and host a relatively diverse flora and fauna if managed to
promote habitat features. Cyclical harvest may render the habitat
periodically unsuitable for some biota. Mixed cropping systems may
comprise two vertical strata of woody crops or a woody and herbaceous
layer. Secondary successional processes involve colonisation and
regeneration, initially of opportunistic biota. Successional feedbacks
occur as structural complexity increases, promoting visits or
colonisation by vertebrates and the associated dispersal of plants and
other organisms. Crop replacement (which may occur on
[multi-]{.mark}annual or decadal cycles), the intensive management of
plantation structure, or the control of non-target species may reset,
arrest, or redirect successional processes. Examples with increasing
management intervention include: environmental plantations established
for wildlife or ecosystem services; agroforestry plantings for
subsistence products or livestock benefits; forestry plantations for
timber, pulp, fibre, bio-energy, rubber, or oils; and vineyards,
orchards, and other perennial food crops (e.g. cassava, coffee, tea,
palm oil, and nuts). Secondary (regrowth) forests and shrublands are not
included as plantations even where management includes supplementary
translocations.

***Ecological drivers***: High to moderate
natural availability of water and nutrients is supplemented by human
inputs of fertiliser or mulch, landscape drainage modifications (e.g.
surface earthworks), and, in intensively managed systems, irrigation.
Rainfall is at least seasonally high. Temperatures are mild to warm, at
least seasonally. Artificial disturbance regimes involving the complete
or partial removal of biomass and soil turnover are implemented at
sub-decadal to multi-decadal frequencies.

***Distribution***: Tropical to cool
temperate humid climatic zones or river flats in dry climates across
south sub-Saharan and Mediterranean Africa, Europe, Asia, southern
Australia, Oceania, and the Americas.
