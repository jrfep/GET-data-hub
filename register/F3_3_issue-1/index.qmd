## Proposed revision

The name of this ecosystem functional group in version 2.1 of the Global Ecosystem Typology is *Rice paddies*. However, the description of the ecosystem functional group accommodates a broader range of crops than just rice, and dry rice croplands fall within T7.1. We thus note the potential alternative name *Aquatic and semi-aquatic croplands*.

***Revision summary***: Rename *F3.3 Aquatic and semi-aquatic croplands* 

***Origin***: Agricultural ecosystems WG (Driver & Botts 2025)

***Justification***: Accommodate aquatic crops other than rice

***Current status***: Proposal considered by GET-SC on 8/9/2025 and approved  for public consultation on draft update.

***Ecosystem properties***: [These
ecosystems]{.mark} are artificial wetlands with low horizontal and
vertical heterogeneity fed by rain or irrigation water diverted from
rivers. They are predominantly temporary wetlands, regularly filled and
dried, although some are permanently inundated, functioning as
simplified marshes. Allochthonous inputs come from water inflow but also
include the introduction of [aquatic crops such as rice, lotus or
tarot,]{.mark} other production organisms (e.g. fish and crustaceans),
and fertilisers that promote [plant]{.mark} growth. Simplified trophic
networks are sustained by seasonal, deterministic flooding and drying
regimes and the agricultural management of harvest crops, weeds, and
pests. Cultivated macrophytes dominate primary production, but other
autotrophs [contribute]{.mark}, including archaea, cyanobacteria,
phytoplankton, and benthic or epiphytic algae. During flooded periods,
microbial changes produce anoxic soil conditions and emissions by
methanogenic archaea. Opportunistic colonists include consumers such as
zooplankton, insects, fish, frogs, and waterbirds, as well as other
aquatic plants. Often they come from nearby natural wetlands or rivers
and may breed within [these croplands]{.mark}. During dry phases,
obligate aquatic organisms are confined to wet refugia [beyond the
croplands]{.mark}. These species possess traits that promote tolerance
to low water quality and predator avoidance. Others organisms, including
many invertebrates and plants, have rapid life cycles and dormancy
traits allowing persistence as eggs or seeds during dry phases.

***Ecological drivers***: Engineering of
levees and channels enables the retention of standing water a few
centimetres above the soil surface and rapid drying at harvest time.
This requires reliable water supply either through summer rains in the
seasonal tropics or irrigation in warm-temperate or semi-arid climates.
The water has high oxygen content and usually warm temperatures.
Deterministic water regimes and shallow depths limit niche diversity and
have major influences on the physical, chemical, and biological
properties of soils, which contain high nutrient levels. [Aquatic
croplands]{.mark} are often established on former floodplains but may
also be created on terraced hillsides. Other human interventions include
cultivation and harvest, aquaculture, and the addition of fertilisers,
herbicides, and pesticides.

***Distribution***: More than a million square kilometres, mostly in
tropical and subtropical Southeast Asia, with small areas in Africa,
Europe, South America, North America, Australia [and Pacific]{.mark}.
