The name of this ecosystem functional group in version 2.1 of the Global Ecosystem Typology is *Annual croplands*. However, from an ecosystem functioning perspective perennial herbaceous croplands share characteristics with annual croplands and fit best in this ecosystem functional group. We thus note the potential alternative name Herbaceous croplands, reflecting an expansion in scope to include both annual and perennial herbaceous crops.

***Revision summary***: Rename *T7.1 Short-rotation croplands* or *Herbaceous/non-woody croplands*

***Origin***: Agricultural ecosystems WG (Driver & Botts 2025)

***Justification***: Some intensive croplands are turned over on longer than annual cycles (e.g. biennial crops or in climates with interannually variable rainfall) but share many features with annual croplands

***Current status***: Proposal considered by GET-SC on 8/9/2025 and approved  for public consultation on draft update

## T7.1 [Short-rotation]{.mark} croplands

***Ecosystem properties***:
High-productivity croplands are maintained by intensive anthropogenic
supplementation of nutrients, water, and artificial disturbance regimes
(e.g. annual cultivation), translocation (e.g. sowing), and harvesting
of short-lived plants. These systems are typically dominated by one or
few shallow-rooted, short-lived, [typically non-woody]{.mark} plant
species such as grains (mostly C3 grasses), vegetables, 'flowers',
legumes, or fibre species harvested [destructively or renewed on cycles
of less than one to a few year]{.mark}s by humans for commercial or
subsistence production of food, materials, or ornamental displays.
Disequilibrium community structure and composition is maintained by
translocations and/or managed reproduction of target species and usually
by periodic application of herbicides and pesticides and/or culling to
exclude competitors, predators, herbivores, and/or pathogens. Thus,
compared to antecedent 'natural' systems, croplands are structurally
simple, have low functional, genetic, and taxonomic diversity and no
local endemism. Subsistence croplands, including Swidden rotation
systems, are typically more diverse than industrial croplands.
Productivity is highly sensitive to variations in resource availability.
Target biota are genetically manipulated by selective breeding or
molecular engineering to promote rapid growth, efficient resource
capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and
tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, insect predators, and
diseases. Typically, at least 40% of net primary productivity is
appropriated by humans. Croplands may be rotated inter-annually with
livestock pastures or fallow fields
([T7.2](https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T7.2)) or may be
integrated into mixed cropping-livestock systems. Target biota coexists
with a cosmopolitan ruderal biota (e.g. weedy plants, mice, and
starlings) that exploits production landscapes opportunistically through
efficient dispersal, itinerant foraging, rapid establishment, high
fecundity, and rapid population turnover. Native biota from adjoining
non-anthropogenic systems may also interact with croplands. When
actively managed systems are abandoned or managed less intensively,
these non-target biota, especially non-woody plants, become dominant and
may form a steady, self-maintaining state or a transitional phase to
novel ecosystems.

***Ecological drivers***: The high to
moderate natural availability of water (from at least seasonally high
rainfall) and nutrients (from fertile soils) is often supplemented by
human inputs via irrigation, landscape drainage modifications (e.g.
surface earthworks), and/or fertiliser application by humans.
Intermittent flooding may occur where croplands replace palustrine
wetlands. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. These
systems are typically associated with flat to moderate terrain
accessible by machinery. Artificial disturbance regimes (e.g. annual
ploughing) maintain soil turnover, aeration, nutrient release, and
relatively low soil organic carbon content.


***Distribution***: Tropical to temperate
humid climatic zones or river flats in dry climates across south
sub-Saharan and North Africa, Europe, Asia, southern Australia, Oceania,
and the Americas.
