## Scientific committee

The IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (GET) was developed by Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) Thematic Group of the Commission on Ecosystem Management (CEM) and led to IUCN Publication, dedicated web app (<https://global-ecosystems.org>), and scientific articles.

IUCN is committed to maintaining the Global Ecosystem Typology as the global knowledge base on ecosystems continually grows. 

The ***Global Ecosystem Typology Scientific Committee (GET-SC)*** was established in 2024 to advise on scientific and technical aspects of the maintenance and update of the GET to ensure high standards of scientific excellence and its fitness for purpose across diverse applications.

advise on the maintenance of the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology and proposed updates. Updates may include revisions to ecosystem descriptions or maps, how lower levels of the typology will be populated and, where essential, changes to upper levels of classification, given the need for overall stability of the framework to serve its purposes effectively. 

The Committee will comprise a small core group of global experts and young professionals, with provisions for invited topic experts, where required to resolve specific update issues. 

The committee meets virtually at least twice per year.

Terms of reference for the committee are available upon request.
